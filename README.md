## Contribution rules:

* Feel free to fork, create pull requests, wiki pages etc. I will be thankful for your help!  

## Will this script run on firmware X.X.X?

* If you will find subdirectory in this repository with firmware version (like bitrate) than you have to be aware of choosing proper script for your firmware version
* If there is no subdirectory (like autostart_record) you can be sure that it will work for all firmwares and all camera revisions.
* In general - all scripts where bites are overwriten (writeb/writew) needs to be checked with firmware/revision version.

## General rule:

* Please be adviced that scripts here are without any warranty. Therefore use them at your own risk, even if they were succesfully tested!
